Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :  32

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:OldMap:206 - NCD was not produced. All logic was removed from design.
   This is usually due to having no input or output PAD connections in the
   design and no nets or symbols marked as 'SAVE'. You can either add PADs or
   'SAVE' attributes to the design, or run 'map -u' to disable logic trimming in
   the mapper.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:OldMap:75 - Chipcheck: The signal "RESET" is connected to the
   asynchronous set/reset of every flip-flop in the design.  Using the dedicated
   GSR/GR (global set/reset) pin on the STARTUP component will reduce the
   ammount of routing resources required to implement the design.  To use
   GSR/GR, disconnect the "RESET" signal from the reset pin of every flip-flop
   in the design, and connect it to the GSR/GR pin of the STARTUP component. 
   Note that all flip-flops on the device will be cleared when GSR/GR goes
   active.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
2957 block(s) removed
2664 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
